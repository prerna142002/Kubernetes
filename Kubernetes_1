Monolithic is always faster 
and in Microservices we have an extra call for which we call between services.

So, previously we used to have bare metals and due to which memory used to be wasted alot.
-> Virtual Machine came into existance.
   => we can have limited vitual machines 
   => we divide the memory , OS also wastes memory, 

Containers are easy to make and distribute

Linux Namespace

Containers use this concept.

pid1 -> Proces Id
root filesystem -> Filesystem
eth0 network interface -> Network
Process inside container to share memory -> Interprocess communication
own hostname -> Unix timesharing system
own root user for container -> User
 |
map to different user on the host - Linux
