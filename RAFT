Consensus
1. Agreement on shared state ( single system image)
2. Reconvers from server failures autonomously.
3. Key to building consistent storage systems.

Inside a Consistent System
1. TODO: eliminate single ppoint of failure.

REPLICATE STATE MACHINE
This is used to build Replicated State Machine build in large Systems

PAXOS PROTOCOL
The dirty little secret of the NSDI community is that most five people really, truly understand every part of Paxos.

So, designed RAFT -
We wanted the best algorithm for building real systems.
1. Must be correct, complete and perform well
2. Must also be understandable.

What would be easier to understand or explain
1. Fundamentally different decompisition than Paxos.
2. less complexity in state space.
3. Less mechanism.

RAFT Overview:
1. Leader election -
  a. Select one of the servers to act as cluster leader.
  b. Detect crashes, chose new leeader.

2. Log replication (normal operation)
  a. Leader takes commands from clients, appends them to its log.
  b. Leader replicated its log to other servers (overwriting inconsistencies)

3. Safety
  a. Only a server with an up-to-date log can become leader.
